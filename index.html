            This project required six custom gift card designs. The cards had to have a minimal artistic style to match brand identity and seemlessly be integrated to their 
            current collection. The package included three general brand designs, christmas, thank you, and happy birthday.

                 <br>A second project for The Boston Terrier Rescue required the a full color, tri-fold brochure to represent the organization and their mission to save Boston Terriers.

        <br>Pitorro is a distilled spirit from Puerto Rico referred to as “moonshine rum”. This centuries old spirit dates back to when Puerto Rico’s sugar cane industry 
        was booming, and as time has gone by, it has become a part of Puerto Rican tradition. El Boricuazo is a pitorro distillery that hopes to capture Puerto Rican pride 
        with their branding to share with the world. The scope of the projects was to create custom beverage label designs for the launch of their new products. El Boricuazo launched an original flavor, 
        tamarind, and coquito flavor for the holiday season. Each label was created in a similar style, but also unique to their flavor, and as vibrant as the Puerto Rican culture they want to embody with 
        their product.
